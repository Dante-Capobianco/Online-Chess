# Download on VSCode & Play Your Friends in Terminal Chess!
**From scratch, I created a two player, local multiplayer, terminal-based chess game. It uses Java classes and various logic structures to replicate the game of chess in any computer terminal.**

By simply inputting the initial position (row & column) and desired final position of the piece you wish to move, the program will move your chess piece, visualized as unicode symbols, around on the virtual board! Run the game using the Main.java file in the "src" folder and make sure the encoding used in your code editor when opening the game files is set to UTF-8 to ensure the unicode symbols are supported and display properly!
