# Download & Play Your Friends in Terminal Chess!
**From scratch, I created a two player, local multiplayer, terminal-based chess game. It uses Java classes and various logic structures to replicate the game of chess in any computer terminal.**

By simply inputting the initial position (row & column) and desired final position of the piece you wish to move, the program will move your chess piece, visualized as unicode symbols, around on the virtual board!
